Project home page: http://jebaird.com/blog/dragtable-jquery-ui-widget-re-arrange-table-columns-drag-drop


#Getting started development

dragtable uses steal(https://github.com/bitovi/steal) and funcunit(https://github.com/bitovi/funcunit) for testing.

fork this repo and run

git submodule init

git submodule update

this should pull down steal and funcunit 

then go into funcunit/ and run the same commands

you should be already for testing and development
